Spaghetti is a type of pasta made from wheat and water. It is one of the most popular dishes in Italian cuisine.

To cook spaghetti, you need to bring a pot of water to a boil. Add a pinch of salt to enhance the flavor of the pasta.

Once the water is boiling, add the spaghetti and cook for 8-10 minutes, or until al dente.

Tomato sauce is the classic pairing for spaghetti. It is made from tomatoes, garlic, onions, and herbs.

Other variations include cream-based sauces like Alfredo, or olive oil with garlic and chili flakes.

Spaghetti can also be paired with meatballs, which are usually made from ground beef, breadcrumbs, and spices.

Don't forget to garnish your dish with freshly grated Parmesan cheese and a touch of basil.
